## 📖 About Me

Hi! I’m Tehseen—a passionate cloud enthusiast, DevOps learner, and problem solver who loves building, automating, and scaling infrastructure using modern tools. Whether deploying apps with Docker, orchestrating Kubernetes clusters, or creating smart AI workflows, I’m always exploring new technologies and finding creative solutions.

Outside tech, you’ll find me playing cricket, tinkering with automations, or chasing the next big idea.
